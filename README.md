Democratizing access to higher education in Chile with a personalized and accessible web application for everyone. 🌐

They say practice makes perfect, and we make practice. That's why here you'll find 15-minute micro-essays that adapt to each student's level. ✍️ Instead of "forcing" students to do extensive essays, we propose short and constant practices that, accumulated, are equivalent to multiple complete essays. 📚 This makes preparation more accessible and motivating, allowing students to integrate study into their daily routine without feeling overwhelmed. 😊
